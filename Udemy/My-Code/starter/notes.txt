Imp:- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

$ CSS describes the visual style and presentation of the content written in HTML.
$ CSS consists of countless properties that developers use to format the content: properties about font, text, spacing, layout, etc.
# h1 -> selector ; font-size -> property ; 20px -> value ;
# font-size: 20px -> Declaration/style (Property + value = Declaration) ;
# Many Declarations/Styles = Declaration Block ;
# Selector + Declaration Block = CSS Rule ;
@ Default font size is 16px in a page.

Imp:- Color Models.

** RGB Model :- Red, Green and Blue. => Each of the base colors can take a value between 0 to 255, which leads to 16.8 million colors.
 
 * For Red -> 255, 0, 0 (R, G, B)
 * For Green-> 0, 255, 0 (R, G, B)
 * For Blue -> 0, 0, 255 (R, G, B)

 * For White -> 255, 255, 255 (R, G, B)
 * For Black -> 0, 0, 0 (R, G, B)

 * For Magenta (Red + Blue) -> 255, 0, 255 (R, G, B)
 * For Yellow (Red + Green) -> 255, 255, 0 (R, G, B)
 * For Cyan (Green + Blue) -> 0, 255, 255 (R, G, B)

 ** RGB / RGBA Notation :-

 * Regular RGB Model => rgb(0, 255, 255) => Cyan Color || rgb(244, 179, 63) => Orange Color
 * RGB with Transparency ("alpha") => rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3) => Transparent Cyan || rgba(244, 179, 63, 0.7) => Transparent Orange.

 **HEXADECIMAL Notation :-

 * Instead of using a scale from 0 to 255, we go from 0 to ff (255 in Hexadecimal numbers)
 * #00ffff => Cyan Color

 * Shorthand, when all color are identical pairs -> #0ff => Cyan Color using shorthand

 * In practice, we mostly use hexadecimal colors, and rgba when we need transparency.
 
 ** SHADES OF GREY :-

 * When colors in all 3 channels are the same, we get a grey color.
 * There are 256 pure grays to choose from.

 * rgb(0, 0, 0) / #000000 / #000
 * rgb(69 , 69, 69) / #444444 / #444
 * rgb(125 , 125, 125) / #7d7d7d
 * rgb(183, 183, 183) / #b7b7b7
 * rgb(255 , 255, 255) / #ffffff / #fff

---> CSS Box Model <---

  ----> Content: Text, images, etc.
  ----> Border: A line around the element,still inside of the element.
  ----> Padding: Invisible space around the content, inside the ::-webkit-progress-inner-element.
  ----> Margin: Space outside of the element, between elements.
  ----> Fill area: Area that gets filled with background color or background image (the whole visible element part is covered here) 

---> Element Height and width calculation:

  ----> Final element width = left border + left padding + width + right padding + right border
  ----> Final element height = top border + top padding + height + bottom padding + bottom border

  * We can specify all these values using CSS properties.
  * This is the default behavior, but we can change it.

  -> check .main-header, li, li:last-child, body(wrong approach as it doesn't get inherited), *, etc for example.

 Imp: Remember collapsing margin

---> Adding Dimensions <--- 
  -> check aside for examples on it.

---> Types of Boxes <---
  --> Block-Level Elements (Block-Level Boxes.)
    # Elements are formatted visually as blocks.
    # Elemets occupy 100% of parent element's width, no matter the content.
    # Elements are stacked vertically by default, one after another.
    # The box-model applies as showed earlier.
    * Ex: body, main, header, footer, section, h1-h6, etc. 
    @ With CSS:- display: block;

  --> Inline Elements (Inline Boxes.)
    # Occupies only the space necessary for its content.
    # Causes no line-breaks after or before the element.
    # Box model applies in a different way: heights and widths do not apply.
    ! Paddings and margins are applied only horizontally (left and right)
    * Ex: Strong, Emphasize, a, img, button etc. 
    @ With CSS:- display: inline;

  --> Inline-Block Boxes
    # Looks like inline from outside, behaves like block-level on the inside.
    # Occupies only content's space.
    # Causes no line-breaks.
    # Box-model applies as showed.
    @ With CSS:- display: inline-block;

---> Normal Flow vs Absolute Positioning
  --> Normal Flow
    # Default positioning
    # Element is "in Flow"
    # Elements are simply laid out according to their order in the HTML code
    @ Default Positioning:- position: relative;

  --> Absolute Positioning
    # Element is removed from the normal flow: "out of flow"
    # No impact on surrounding elements, might overlap them
    # We use top, bottom, left, or right to offset the element from its relatively positioned container
    @ Absoulte Positioning:- position: absolute;

---> After and Before Pseudo element
  # ::before is used to place it at the beginning of the element, 
  # ::after is used to place it at the end of the element

----> What Does "Layout" Mean ?.

  --> Layout is the way text, images and other content is placed and arranged on a webpage.
  --> Layout gives the page a visual structure, into which we place our content.
  --> Building a Layout: Arranging page elements into a visual structure, instead of simply having them placed one after another (normal flow).

  --->Page Layout vs Component Layout.

  -->Page Layout is a layout design in which the design of the complete page is done. A Page Layout is the combination of component layout.
  -->Component Layout is a layout design in which the design of a specific element(component) is done.

  ---> Float Layouts:

  --> The old way of building layouts of all sizes, using the float CSS property. Still used, but getting outdated fast.

  --->Flexbox:

  --> Modern way of laying out elements in a 1-dimensional row without using floats. Perfect for component layouts.

  --->CSS Grid:

  --> For laying out element in a fully-fledged 2-dimensional grid. Perfect for page layouts and complex components.

----> Float Layout:

  ---> Normal Flow vs Absolute Positioning vs Floats

  --> Normal Flow
    # Default positioning
    # Element is "in Flow"
    # Elements are simply laid out according to their order in the HTML code
    @ Default Positioning:- position: relative;

  --> Absolute Positioning
    # Element is removed from the normal flow: "out of flow"
    # No impact on surrounding elements, might overlap them
    # We use top, bottom, left, or right to offset the element from its relatively positioned container
    @ Absoulte Positioning:- position: absolute;

  --> Floats
    # Element is removed from the normal flow: "out of flow"
    # Text and inline elements will wrap around the floated element
    # The container will not adjust its height to the element
    @ Floats Positioning:- float: left; | float: right;

  --> Clear
    # Used to remove the float property from the element
    @ Clear:- clear: left; | clear: right; | clear: both;

  --> The Box Model with Box-Sizing: Border-BOX
    # Using this model the Final element width and Final element height changes to.
    $ Final element width = width, Final element height = height
    # check aside selector

----> Flex Layout:
  ---> What is Flex Box?
  --> Flexbox is a set of related css properties for building 1-dimnesional layouts.
  --> The main idea behind flexbox is that empty space inside a container element can be automatically divided by its child element.
  --> Flexbox makes it easy to automatically align items to one another inside a parent container, both horizontally and vertically.
  --> Flexbox solves common problems such as vertical centering and creating equal-height columns.
  --> Flexbox is perfect for replacing floats, allowing us to write fewer and cleaner HTML and CSS code. 

  * The element in which we need to use flex is called flex container.
  @ display: flex;
  ------> All the chlid elements inside the flex container are called flex-items
  # Main Axis (Horizontal) and Cross Axis(Vertical)
